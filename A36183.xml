            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>And that this is properly near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of kin, or flesh, may appear by the Prohibition to the High-Priest, that he may not be defiled for the Dead among his people, but for his Kin, that is near unto him he may; For his Mother and Father, for his Son and Daughter, for his Brother and [Virgin] Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>

               <head>No Cosin Germans at all.</head>
               <p>By the Civil Law the same Nearnesses are forbidden, and no farther; excepting as <hi>Æ²lpian</hi> in his Rules observes, thus: <hi>In Quarto [Gradu] permittitur [Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubium] extra eos Personas quae Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum Leberorumque locum habent.</hi> Therefore says he, The Great Aunt by the Fathers and by the Mothers side, and the Sisters Neece may not Marry, <hi>Quamvis quarto gradu sint,</hi> because the Prohibition is not alwayes for the

               <p>In Cosins in the Equal Side-Lines, the farther off the less rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they should be forbidden, but in Uncles and Aunts in the Descending unequal Side-Lines, the farther off the greater reason they should be forbidden.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son between the Cognation of Uncles and Aunts, and their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews or Neeces, in the unequal Descending Side-Lines, and the Cognation of Cosins in the Equal Side Lines.</p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>In pari Cognationis gradu, paridemque jus Statuatur:</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49286:14"/>is not <hi>Immediate, Proximous</hi> and <hi>Prime</hi> in the first Degree, but <hi>Mediate, Propinquous</hi> and <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary,</hi> through and by the means of two common Parents:</p>
            <p>For no Blood is derived or passed from me to my Sister, nor from her to me; but Blood is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived or passed from our Parents to each of us, and in us their Blood is parted.</p>
            <p>My Mother therefore, who derives her Blood to me immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, must needs be more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguineous, or nearer of Kin to me than my Sister, who derives no Blood at all to me, but only takes part of the same Blood with me. And my Daughter, who derives her Blood immediately from me, must needs be more Consanguineous or nearer of Kin to me than my Sister, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives no Blood at all from me.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49286:15"/>
            <p> My Mother therefore upwards, and my Daughter downwards are the Females of nearest Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity or Kindred to me: And therefore they make the first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; for that which in order is the nearest or next to me, must needs be the first from me: And Consequently my Sister being not so near to me in Consanguinity, Kindred or Blood, as is my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Daughter, cannot be computed in the first Degree; and therefore must either be in the second Degree, or in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree more remote, or else in no Degree at all.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that in many Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Pedigrees the Lines are drawn and visibly expressed in the right Line or Linage only, and they are drawn downwards only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Descent from the Parents to the Children.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49286:15"/>
            <p> Because the course of the Blood which makes Consanguinity, pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only by Descent downwards.</p>
            <p>But sideward in the Side-Line or Linage, no Lines at all are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly drawn and expressed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Blood hath no passage at all that way; for there was none at all, neither from the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Sister, nor from her to him.</p>
            <p>So that they partake not of one anothers Blood, but both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their Parents Blood, which descends in Common to them both, and in them is parted and divided into several Channels, making several descents; yet for Computation sake there are Lines conveyed sideward in the Side-Line or Linage, not Lines real and visible, but only imaginative and putative; such as Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers conceive in Heaven, and

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Degree. </seg>4</label> The Fourth Degree sideward between Brothers and Sisters Children, or Cousin Germans is thus: from me upward to my Father or Mother is one Degree,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49286:17"/>from my Father or Mother to their Father or Mother, or my Grandfather or Grandmother is Two Degrees: Then from my Grandfather or Grandmother, which are the common Stock downwards to their Son or Daughter, which sideward are my Father and Mother, Brother and Sister, and my Uncle and Aunt, is Three Degrees; &amp; from my Uncle and Aunt downwards to their Son or Daughter, which are my Cousin Germans, is Four De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>This Computation of Degrees is according to the Civil Law, whose Rule is this, <hi>Tot sunt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Cognationis, quot sunt Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones,</hi> 1. So many Generations so many Degrees.</p>
            <p>The Computation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law is, <hi>Quoto Gradu unus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis{que} eorum distat a communi

            <p>So that Brothers and Sisters Children, that by the Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Civil Law differ Four Degrees from each other, by the Canon Law they differ but Two Degrees from each other.</p>
            <p>So that the Civil Law consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth Degrees, especially for Successions of Inheritances from Person to Person, numbering the Degrees according to single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, only by one Degree at once, ascending to the next or nearest Common Stock or Parent, and thence descending to the Person whose Degree is required. But the Cannon Law considereth rather the Degrees of Marriage
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49286:18"/>made by the consent of Two Persons, and for that reason joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Two Persons together in the numbring of Degrees.</p>
            <p>As to Cousin Germans there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (to conclude) though some Divines and some Lawyers here in <hi>England</hi> do scruple at the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness of their Marriage; yet they scruple it without alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any sound Reason, but rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only upon Tradition, and the long practice of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, who have forbidden those Marriages for meer Lucre, to Gain Money for the Licencing of them, by Dispensations, which are denyed to none, but are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of course, for Money, to all that desire them. But from the beginning it was not so, neither ought it to be so; because the Rule holds good, <hi>Quod ab initio non valuit, illud tractu Temporis

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49286:23"/>to me by my own Kindred, 1. My Kinsmen and my Kinswomen, there accrues unto me if I be Married a great Stock of Affinity by my Wife.</p>
            <p>Yet a Man and his Wife are properly of no Kin at all, neither by Consanguinity, or Affinity in any Degree of Propinquity nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before Marriage nor after.</p>
            <p>Not before Marriage, because their Consanguinity or Affinity in any Degree of Propinquity would be so just an Impediment against their Marriage, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they might not Marry at all, or if they did Marry, their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage would be accounted unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Incestuous.</p>
            <p>Nor after Marriage, because Consanguinity and Affinity lyeth necessarily between two distinct Persons, who make the distinct terms of those Relations.</p>
            <p>But a Man and his Wife though
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49286:23"/>naturally and sensibly they are Two distinct Persons, yet Jurally and Legally in the Estimation of Law, they are no more two but one Person, or as the Scripture phraseth it. <hi>They Two are no more Two, but one Flesh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19.6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, after Marriage a man is nearer to his Wife than to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother; for he must leave his Father and Mother and cleave to his Wife: But a Mans Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity with his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in the first Degree, and therefore there can be no Degree of Consanguinity with his Wife, because there can be no Degree before the first.</p>
            <p>The Marriage therefore of Man and Wife effecteth neither Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity nor Affinity, but an Unity, which is a Conjunction more Entire, more Perfect, more Eminent, or more transcendent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49286:24"/>than any Consanguinity or Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can possibly be.</p>
            <p>And though this Union by Marriage be neither Consanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor Affinity, yet without Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age there is no lawful Consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity nor Affinity, but Bastardy.</p>
            <p>For Marriage is the Ground and Cause of both those Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is the Seed and Root from whence they arise, and it is the Terme or Point from whence their Degrees are measured.</p>
            <p>And Consequently a Man and his Wife are neither <hi>Affines</hi> nor <hi>Consanguinei,</hi> but <hi>Conjuges.</hi> That is, neither of Alliance or Blood, but Conjoyned in one Person in Law, and Yoke-Fellows in one Sacred Band of Wedlock.</p>
            <p>And though in some passages of the Civil Law they be called Affines, yet that Appellation must be construed for a Metaphor and an Impropriety.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49286:24"/>
            <p> Now the Affinity that ariseth unto me by my Wife, is easily computed thus.</p>
            <p>My Wives <hi>Consanguinei</hi> or Cousins are Affines or Allies to me, and are in the same Degree of Affinity to me, as they stand in Degree of Consanguinity to her.</p>
            <p>And therefore my Wives own Father and Mother are my Father in Law and Mother in Law, which to me is Affinity in the first Degree of Consanguinity.</p>
            <p>So my Wives own Brothers and Sisters are my Brothers in Law and Sisters in Law, which is Affinity in the Second Degree.</p>
            <p>So my VVives own Uncles and Aunts are my Uncles in Law and Aunts in Law, which is Affinity in the Third Degree.</p>
            <p>And <hi>vice versa</hi> my <hi>Consangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nei</hi> or Cousins, are Affines or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to my VVife in the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49286:25"/>of Affinity as they are to me of Consanguinity.</p>
            <p>And therefore my own Father and Mother are my VVives Father in Law and Mother in Law, which is Affinity in the first Degree.</p>
            <p>So my own Brothers and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, are Brothers in Law and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in Law to my VVife, which is Affinity in the Second Degree.</p>
            <p>And so my own Uncles and Aunts are Uncles in Law and Aunts in Law to my VVife, which is Affinity in the Third Degree.</p>
            <p>In Affinity therefore as to the Point of Marriage; so many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are forbidden, as there are restrained in Consanguinity by Blood.</p>
            <p>As therefore in Consanguinity, I may not Marry any of my Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or Cousins in the First, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or Third Degree, so in Affinity I may not Marry any of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49286:25"/>my Affines or Allies in the First, Second, or Third Degree. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Affinity arise to me from my own Kindred, or from my VVives Kindred.</p>
            <p>But it must be observed, That though Consanguinity by the means of Marriage breed Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet Affinity so bred, begets no farther Affinity.</p>
            <p>And therefore though my VVives Kindred are Cousins or Allies to me, yet they are not Allies to my Kindred or Cousins.</p>
            <p>So that though my VVives Father &amp; Mother are Allies to me, yet they are not Allies to my own Father &amp; Mother, nor to my own Brothers &amp; Sisters, nor to my own Sons and Daughters if I had any by my former VVife.</p>
            <p>So likewise my VVives own Brothers and Sisters, though they be Allied to me, yet they are not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49286:26"/>Allied to my own Father and Mother, nor to my own Brothers and Sisters, nor to my own Sons and Daughters, if I had any by my former VVife.</p>
            <p>So again my VVives own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if she had any by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Husband, though they be Allies to me, yet they are not Allies to my own Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor to my own Brothers and Sisters, nor to my own Sons and Daughters, if I had any by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer VVife.</p>

            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> in Case of marriage forbids no more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Consanguinity or Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than are forbidden in the Civil
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49286:27"/>Law. Yet she numbers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the Degrees somewhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, following therein the Accompt of the Canon Law.</p>
            <p>For she accounts Brothers and Sisters to be in the first Degree of the side Line; whereas the Civil Law accounts them in the second Degree of the side Line, and makes no first Degree in that Line at all.</p>
            <p>But the matter comes all to one pass, as some Players at <hi>Gleek,</hi> reckon their Games dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, and yet accord well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the sum of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>For if we consider the side Line alone by its self, as there are several Persons in it, then some of those Persons must needs make the first Degree of the side Line in respect of the Persons following therein. But if we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49286:28"/>look upon the Standard of the Pedigree, or the Person whose Consanguinity is required, and from whom the Degrees thereof are measured and numbred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, downward, and sideward, Then the Persons of the first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the side Line, must needs make the second Degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity in respect of the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, or Person supposed whose Consanguinity is required, and from whom the Degrees are to be measured, according to the course whereby the Blood is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, which doth constitute Consanguinity, as before hath been intimated.</p>
            <p>The Levitical Laws for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, do now bind Us of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Yet this Truth is to be understood with some Caution.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:49286:28"/>
            <p> For albeit these Laws do bind us, yet they bind us not by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, because their Obligation by Divine Authority ceased, expired, and dyed at the death of Christ.</p>
            <p>And thereupon all Christian Churches were left to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Liberties to follow such Rules, Orders, Measures, and Degrees, as by right Reason, and Christian Prudence should be established.</p>
            <p>For the determination whereof the Church of <hi>England</hi> conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it the most prudent course to make the Levitical Laws her President and Pattern; and at last assumed them, and adopted them into her own Canons and Statutes; reviving unto them an Obligation, not of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as once they had from God, but of Humane Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
